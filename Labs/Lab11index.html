            <h2>CS:GO Skin Market Overview</h2>
            
            <p>The Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) skin market has evolved into a unique digital economy where virtual weapon skins can command significant real-world value. These cosmetic items vary in rarity, wear condition, and pattern, which directly influences their market price.</p>
            
            <p>Market trends show that rare knife skins and popular rifle skins, particularly for the AK-47 and M4A4, tend to maintain their value well over time. Factors such as professional player usage, tournament events, and game updates can significantly impact skin prices. Understanding these dynamics helps traders make informed decisions about when to buy, sell, or hold specific items in their inventory.</p>
            
            <h3>Skin Rarity Tiers</h3>
            <p>CS:GO skins are categorized into different rarity tiers, from common to extremely rare. Consumer Grade (white) skins are the most common, followed by Industrial Grade (light blue), Mil-Spec (blue), Restricted (purple), Classified (pink), and finally Covert (red) skins which are the rarest standard drops. Additionally, there are special categories like knives and gloves that are exceptionally rare and valuable.</p>
            
            <h3>Wear Conditions</h3>
            <p>Each skin has a wear rating that affects its appearance and value. The conditions range from Factory New (minimal wear, highest value) to Battle-Scarred (heavily worn, typically lower value). This "float value" is a number between 0 and 1 that determines exactly how worn a skin appears, with lower numbers indicating better condition. Some skins actually develop unique patterns or appearances at certain wear levels, making some Battle-Scarred variants surprisingly valuable.</p>
