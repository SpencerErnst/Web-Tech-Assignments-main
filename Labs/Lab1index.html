    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>As an avid gamer and CS:GO enthusiast, so I created this website to share my knowledge about the CS:GO skins marketplace, analyzing trends, and helping others understand the factors that influence skin values. With several years of trading experience, I've developed insights into what makes certain skins retain their value while others depreciate. Through this site, I hope to provide valuable information for both new traders and experienced collectors in the CS:GO community.</p>
    
    <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
    <p>I will build a site that will feature comprehensive information about various weapon skins, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knife collections</li>
        <li>Rifle skins</li>
        <li>Pistol skins</li>
        <li>SMG collections</li>
        <li>Market analysis and trends</li>
    </ul>
